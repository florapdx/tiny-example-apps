# Tiny Example Apps:
1. Plain JS React
2. React + Redux
3. React + Apollo + GraphQL (CSR-only; incl. subscriptions)
4. React + Apollo + GraphQL (SSR; incl. subscriptions)
5. React + Relay + GraphQL (@TODO subscriptions)

A suite of bite-sized web apps demonstrating some different tooling options and configurations available within the React ecosystem.

While these could be used as bases for larger and more complex apps, this isn't a boilerplate project; these are meant as little demo examples for those that are trying to familiarize themselves (or their teams) with each toolset (general app structure, options, configuration, etc). This could be a good place to start if you are entertaining building a new Apollo app and are struggling with the basic setup or to get subscriptions support working, for example.

I will try to keep these up to date (or keep adding as new tools and/or new major versions are released), and help in so doing would be much appreciated. Would love this to serve as a living reference resource for various toolsets within the React and front-end JS cosmos.
